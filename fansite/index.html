    <h2>Basic Positioning</h2>

    <p>
      Rotation, to put it simply, is a system of strategic movement and
      positioning among a team where players continuously change positions to
      create opportunities on offense or defense. Its main idea is simple: one
      player challenges the ball, then rotates away to collect boost or fill
      empty space on the field, while another moves up to follow-up that
      challenge. This thought process can be applied to (nearly) every game mode
      and can improve a team’s power, speed, and coordination. By utilizing
      rotation in matches, you will start to notice that your overall speed will
      increase, as you’ll always be in motion. Thus, you’ll have more momentum
      going into every challenge. With this, you can be quicker to the ball,
      saving your team many awkward situations on defense and creating them for
      your opponents on offense. You’ll also notice fewer double commitments and
      open nets if your team is rotating correctly, as there should always be
      one person on the ball and one person back.

    <h2>Rotation in Standard (3v3)</h2>

    <p>
      Standard is the most common game mode in competitive Rocket League, so
      every player should know how to rotate effectively in 3v3 matches. Each
      player has a role to play wherever their position on the field. For the
      purposes of this guide, I will refer to players on a team as Player 1, 2,
      or 3.
